# AgenticCoding

## Project Scope

This project is dedicated to learning and exploring **Agentic Coding** — a paradigm where AI coding agents autonomously plan, implement, and refactor code with minimal human intervention. 

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how AI agents can breakdown complex coding tasks into manageable steps
- Explore autonomous code generation, debugging, and optimization techniques
- Learn to work effectively with agentic systems using clear prompts and requirements
- Practice designing systems that allow agents to make decisions and iterate independently
- Study patterns, best practices, and limitations of agentic coding approaches

### Key Focus Areas

- **Agent Autonomy**: Building systems where agents can work toward goals with guidance
- **Code Quality**: Ensuring agent-generated code maintains high standards and best practices
- **Human-Agent Collaboration**: Establishing effective workflows between humans and AI agents
- **Iterative Refinement**: Techniques for agents to improve code through multiple iterations
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down complex requirements for agent execution
